╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

🎯 YOUR SETUP: Fingerpunch Sweeeeep + Liatris (RP2040) Controllers

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 STEP 1: BUILD HANDEDNESS FIRMWARE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Run this script to build both files:
  $ ./build_handedness.sh

Or manually:
  $ qmk compile -kb fingerpunch/sweeeeep -km smathev -e INIT_EE_HANDS_LEFT=yes
  $ cp fingerpunch_sweeeeep_smathev.uf2 fingerpunch_sweeeeep_smathev_LEFT.uf2

  $ qmk compile -kb fingerpunch/sweeeeep -km smathev -e INIT_EE_HANDS_RIGHT=yes
  $ cp fingerpunch_sweeeeep_smathev.uf2 fingerpunch_sweeeeep_smathev_RIGHT.uf2

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 STEP 2: FLASH LEFT HALF
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. ⚡ Unplug BOTH keyboard halves
2. 🔌 Plug in LEFT half to computer
3. 🔘 Double-tap RESET button on Liatris
   └─► A drive named "RPI-RP2" will appear
4. 📋 Copy fingerpunch_sweeeeep_smathev_LEFT.uf2 to the RPI-RP2 drive
5. ⏳ Board reboots automatically (drive disappears = success!)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 STEP 3: FLASH RIGHT HALF
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. ⚡ Unplug BOTH keyboard halves
2. 🔌 Plug in RIGHT half to computer
3. 🔘 Double-tap RESET button on Liatris
   └─► A drive named "RPI-RP2" will appear
4. 📋 Copy fingerpunch_sweeeeep_smathev_RIGHT.uf2 to the RPI-RP2 drive
5. ⏳ Board reboots automatically (drive disappears = success!)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 STEP 4: TEST
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✓ Plug in ONLY left half  → Should type normally
✓ Plug in ONLY right half → Should type normally
✓ Connect both halves     → Should work as full split keyboard

If a half types the wrong keys, re-flash that specific half.

 💡 TIPS & TROUBLESHOOTING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔘 Finding the RESET button:
   - Small tactile button on the Liatris controller PCB
   - Usually located near the USB connector
   - Requires a small tool or fingernail to press

📱 Double-tap timing:
   - Tap quickly like a mouse double-click
   - Too slow = won't work, too fast = won't work
   - Practice a few times to get the timing right

❌ RPI-RP2 drive doesn't appear?
   - Try double-tapping faster or slower
   - Use a data USB cable (not charge-only)
   - Try a different USB port
   - Verify Liatris is properly seated in sockets

🔄 After initial setup:
   - Future firmware updates can be flashed to BOTH halves
   - Handedness is saved in EEPROM and persists
   - Only need handedness files for the FIRST flash or after EEPROM reset
